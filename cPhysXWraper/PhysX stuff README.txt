You'll find the PhyX files on FOL, in the content area of the "Phsyics & Simualation 2" course. 

You'll need the "include" and the "bin" (i.e. library) folders (and the "snippets" folder if you want to see the examples).

BUT the bin (library) folder is around 2.5 GIGA-bytes in size, so I won't be placing that on github.

For the code on FeeneyCodes github, it will point to the folders in this 7.zip file extracted onto the root folder of the C: drive (i.e. extract this folder to the root of C: and the code from class will find it).&nbsp;

Note that to run the PhyX stuff, you'll need the DLL files that are in the "bin" folder, but again, I *won't* be uploading them to github since they are WAY larger than the 50Mbyte github limit.

So my code will assume the PhyX stuff is here: 

C:\PhysX (git)\PhysX\physx\include
C:\PhysX (git)\PhysX\physx\bin            <-- the "library" and DLL files are here

You'll have to copy the DLL files from the bin folder to the output folder.
