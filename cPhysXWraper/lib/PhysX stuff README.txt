You'll find the PhyX files on FOL, in the content area of the "Phsyics & Simualation 2" course. 

You'll need the "include" and the "bin" (i.e. library) folders (and the "snippets" folder if you want to see the examples).&nbsp;

BUT the bin (library) folder is around 2.5 GIGA-bytes in size, so I won't be placing that on github.

For the code on FeeneyCodes github, it will point to the folders in this 7.zip file extracted onto the root folder of the C: drive (i.e. extract this folder to the root of C: and the code from class will find it).&nbsp;

Note that to run the PhyX stuff, you'll need the DLL files that are in the "bin" folder, but again, I *won't* be uploading them to github since they are WAY larger than the 50Mbyte github limit.

So my code will assume the PhyX stuff is here: 

C:\PhysX (git)\PhysX\physx\include
C:\PhysX (git)\PhysX\physx\bin            <-- the "library" and DLL files are here

You'll have to copy the DLL files from the bin folder to the output folder. 


This is the 5.5.1 release (February 2025)

NOTE: There is still an issue with the release build, but I'm working on it!
